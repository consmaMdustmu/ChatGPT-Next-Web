## Step 1: Download a Windows 10 Theme for Wine
 
There are many Windows 10 themes available online, but not all of them are compatible with Wine. One theme that works well with Wine is the Windows\_10.msstyles theme by MagicMaker10 on DeviantArt[^1^]. You can download it from this link: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/704329731125936138/840898242450817084/Windows\_10.msstyles .
 
## Step 2: Install the Theme in Wine
 
After downloading the theme file, you need to install it in Wine. To do that, you need to use the Wine Configuration program, which can be found in the Applications menu, under Wine. Open it and navigate to the Desktop Integration tab. Click the Install Theme button and select the theme file you downloaded. Then select Windows10 from the Theme dropdown menu and click Apply[^1^] [^3^].
 
## Step 3: Enjoy Your New Theme
 
Now your Wine applications should look more like Windows 10. You can also customize the theme further by changing the window colors, fonts, icons, and sounds in the same tab. You can also switch back to the default theme anytime by selecting (Default) from the Theme dropdown menu.

## Why Use a Windows 10 Theme for Wine?
 
There are several reasons why you may want to use a Windows 10 theme for Wine. One reason is to improve the visual consistency of your desktop environment. If you use a Linux theme that is different from the default Wine theme, you may notice some clashes in the colors, fonts, and icons of your Wine applications. By using a Windows 10 theme for Wine, you can make your Wine applications blend in better with your Linux theme.
 
Another reason is to enhance the user experience of your Wine applications. Some Windows applications may rely on certain visual cues or elements that are specific to Windows 10. For example, some applications may use the Windows 10 style buttons, menus, or dialogs. If you use the default Wine theme, these elements may not look or function as intended. By using a Windows 10 theme for Wine, you can ensure that your Wine applications look and behave more like their native counterparts.
 
## What Are the Limitations of Using a Windows 10 Theme for Wine?
 
While using a Windows 10 theme for Wine can improve the appearance and functionality of your Wine applications, it also has some limitations. One limitation is that it may not work with all Wine applications. Some applications may have their own custom themes or skins that override the Wine theme. In that case, you may not see any difference in the look and feel of your application after installing the Windows 10 theme for Wine.
 
Another limitation is that it may not cover all aspects of the Windows 10 interface. The Windows\_10.msstyles theme by MagicMaker10 on DeviantArt only changes the style of the windows, controls, and dialogs of your Wine applications. It does not change the icons, sounds, cursors, or wallpapers of your Wine desktop. If you want to change those aspects as well, you may need to download and install additional themes or packages from other sources.
